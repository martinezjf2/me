        <ul>
            <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/martinezjf2/project1">CountriesApp</a></h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a basic command line interface application with basic ruby language programming skills such as retrieving an API that would help me to establish data and I would create ethods in order to display specific commands.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/martinezjf2/new_app">Vacation Planner</a></h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>During the Flatiron Curriculum, students learn frontend and backend development. Students learn Ruby, JavaScript, Sinatra, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Rails. I learned to use the Sinatra gem in order to establish a basic website with forms for signing up a user and login them in. Also, learning how to interact with the databse was a critical part in making this app successful with good understanding on how to use and implement SQL</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/martinezjf2/rails_project/">Book Library</a></h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a website using a framework on ruby called Rails which helped me organize my directories as well with separation of concerns also know within the MVC model. I created separate controllers for individual models and created views with built-in form helpers. Also, inquired CSS and HTML to present it more organized. I created this for my benefit and for those who love to read books and take note on specific pages in order to keep notes organized from every book I read. I can submit a new note with the page number and display it when i click on the book within the index. Created helper methods as well to establish less repetition of code within the controllers.</li>
